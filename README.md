A nice PHP microframework.

This microframework integrates nikic's [FastRoute](https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute) router with the [Symfony 2 HttpKernel](https://github.com/symfony/http-kernel).

Further improvements to come:

* Some kind of dependency injection solution
* Production/development environments
* Caching of some kind
